- New RollRable: A homebrew Deck of Many Things! It is as balanced as I could make it. I took some inspiration from @4d6.drop.lowest.
There is still a high-risk/high-reward feel to it. I removed "gain xp" cards and cards that insta-kill a character or make
them useless. There are still very dangerous cards, but pretty much all of them have a way to undo the effect or prevent it.
I made The Fates card more interactable. Note that there are no cards which break the world or the campaign, and a lot of them
give tons of flexibility for DMs to play the cards into the adventure/campaign/quest!
