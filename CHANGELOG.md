## 1.4.2 - 2020-06-01
- Fixed a spelling mistake
- New RollRable: A homebrew Deck of Many Things! It is as balanced as I could make it. I took some inspiration from @4d6.drop.lowest.
There is still a high-risk/high-reward feel to it. I removed "gain xp" cards and cards that insta-kill a character or make
them useless. There are still very dangerous cards, but pretty much all of them have a way to undo the effect or prevent it.
I made The Fates card more interactable. Note that there are no cards which break the world or the campaign, and a lot of them
give tons of flexibility for DMs to play the cards into the adventure/campaign/quest!
- New item: Fletcher's Backpack
- New item: Alchemist's Bag
- New compendium pack: Tables!
- New RollTable: list of 100 mockeries! good for vicious mockery, or whenever your bard wants to make fun of someone
- New RollTable: list of 69 (nice) inspirations! Good for bardic inspiration, or whatever.
- New JournalEntry pack: pack of all SRD d&d5e conditions. New homebrew conditions have also been added!
