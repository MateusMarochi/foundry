That gives the creatures time to mate, bring up their litter and have a life of their own, until being called upon again.</p>\n<h2>Spiritual Companion</h2>\n<p>Rather than a corporeal beast, a ranger may choose to have a companion, that inhabits the ethereal plane of existence. Such an entity may be the spiritual guardian of the wilds or the archetypal manifestation of a totem-animal. It may choose to be visible in the prime material plane, as a ghostly apparition, and even become corporeal for a number of times in a day, equal to the ranger’s <strong>Wisdom </strong>modifier. Staying corporeal last for up to 1 hour, or until the spiritual companion is reduced to zero hit points, which prevents the spiritual companion to return to the ranger’s side for 1d10 days.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Super's Pack","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Ranger 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"type":"String","value":""},"critDamage":{"type":"String","value":""},"quickDesc":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickAttack":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickSave":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickDamage":{"type":"Array","value":[],"altValue":[],"context":[]},"quickProperties":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickTemplate":{"type":"Boolean","value":false,"altValue":false},"quickOther":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true,"context":""},"quickFlavor":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true}},"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/yellow_04.jpg"}

Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming,” a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one’s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order’s blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible burden it is and the challenges it brings. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked, mad, even murderous, these blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and blood magic. These factors enable a member of the Order of the Lycan to prevent the spread of their curse through blood, should they wish to. One of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another without the order’s sanction.</p>\n<p>Should a member of the Order of the Lycan be cured of the lycanthropic curse, it is a terrible shame on their name, the order, and those who carry the curse still. There have been passages written about members being cleansed against their will, but those brothers and sisters readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of The Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.</p>\n<p>Lycanthropy comes in many forms. Each version of the curse is bound to a specific beast: wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat are a few of the more well-known variations. The strain of the curse defines the beast a hybrid form will share, but the features the curse bestows remain relatively uniform across strains.</p>\n</section>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Heightened Senses<br></span>When you join this order at 3rd level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.ZA7gVOQqUCQikSfd]{Heightened Senses} feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Hybrid Transformation<br></span>Also at 3rd level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.leTCxnoVASFi1t8q]{Hybrid Transformation} feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Stalker's Prowess<br></span>At 7rd level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.Xz2w4F9rE7Zg3N4c]{Stalker's Prowess} feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Advanced Transformation<br></span>At 11th level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.NDppHiaFCoRAdKBo]{Advanced Transformation} feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Brand of the Voracious<br></span></span>At 15th level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.98s2xb50uKSol7wQ]{Brand of the Voracious} feature.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Hybrid Transformation Mastery<br></span>At 18th level, you gain the @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.oDYc2kHQLSrBbLyc]{Hybrid Transformation Mastery} feature.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Super's Pack","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Blood Hunter 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"type":"String","value":""},"critDamage":{"type":"String","value":""},"quickDesc":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickAttack":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickSave":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickDamage":{"type":"Array","value":[],"altValue":[],"context":[]},"quickProperties":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickTemplate":{"type":"Boolean","value":false,"altValue":false},"quickOther":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true,"context":""},"quickFlavor":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true}},"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg"}

Perhaps you were cursed by a witch or simply had a strange woe afflict you and you are oblivious to its origin. Regardless, you may struggle with your woe defining you, battle to overcome it, or embrace it. Choose at least one Mythic Woe from below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cursed.</span> You are under one of the effects of the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.pO4zGe5LmFIYqJiL]{Bestow Curse} spell, except its effect is permanent and cannot be removed except by a wish spell or by the death of the creature who cursed you.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Exiled.</span> You don't even know of your own nobility. For some reason, you were exiled from the land that is rightfully yours. While you may be extraordinarily charismatic and have a potent personality, you do not know where it hails from. Your majesty comes from an inherent form of entitlement, something that tells you that you are meant for great things, even if you know not what. Exiled nobles are always under the watchful eye of at least one creature, which the noble may or may not know of. Choose one creature from this list that is or has watched over you during your exile: a deva, a cambion, a centaur, a dryad, a faerie dragon, a night hag, a pixie, a satyr, or a sprite. The creature may watch you from afar, or may be under some guise and raising you as their own or some other method of keeping an eye on you. Because of your charisma, your @Compendium[SupersHomebrewPack.class-features.c66dPaaFKWQ1h7qy]{Attendant} is actually a friend of yours or a loyal companion, instead of an attendant who respects you from just your authority. Additionally, you cannot gain the +4 circumstance on the Majesty Score Table when you roll your majesty score until you become aware of your nobility in some way.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Forever Sleepy.</span> You are subject to sleep spells and effects, even if you have immunities from other features or abilities. Whenever you are the target of a sleep spell, count yourself as having half your current hit points as you currently have. Additionally, choose one creature. That creature is your soulmate or savior. Whenever you are the subject of magical sleep, you fall asleep permanently and may not awaken until your soulmate or savior kisses you on your forehead or lips. Should your soulmate or savior ever die, you awaken by the next creature that kisses you on your forehead or lips. Once you are permanently under the effects of a sleep spell or effect, you cannot be so again in a permanent way after you are awakened. You are still vulnerable to the effects, however, as described above.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Feyline.</span> At some point, your ancestors mixed your lineage with fey-blood and this is your fuel of majesty. Fey creatures regard you with curiosity, inherently sensing the feyline within you or feeling a nascent sense of familiarity when in your presence. This may lead to you being some destined noble of fey or of some fey court or kingdom.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Honesty.</span> You are magically compelled to always tell the truth when you are asked a question. This truth is relative to your own understanding of truth and reality, but you cannot willfully lie or be dishonest.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Midnight Form.</span> At dusk, so long as you are within 1 mile of being able to see the night sky, you transform into one of the following creatures: an @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.HB49mCOVBXwWeKWQ]{Orc} of your gender, a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.EZgiprHXA2D7Uyb3]{Frog}, or a swan (use the stats for a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.fnkPNfIpS62LqOu4]{Hawk}). You lose of all your class features and capabilities and act only with the stats provided of your chosen form. When dawn comes, you revert to your normal form and you act as though you had a long rest, whether you rested or not. This woe is dependent upon some factor, creed, doctrine, or curse, usually of the poetic type. Discuss this with your DM to see if you may ever break the curse or how you must follow some doctrine to avoid the midnight form, should you wish to. You may also choose a different creature from the Monsters Manual, but the chosen creature should be of CR 1/2 or lower. If you die in your midnight form, you revert back to your normal form.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Prince/Princess Charming.</span> You are the prince or princess of a kingdom, destined to soley inherit the kingdom and bear the burden of the monarchy. You are inherently good, a pureborn noble who sees only justice, truth, honesty, and charity. You are either Lawful Good or Neutral Good. All of these traits and privileges come with a cost, however. Whenever you perform any action that is a betrayal, goes against your conscious or moral code, leaves the innocent in danger, or some other reason that the DM percieves going against justice, truth, honesty, love, and charity, you incur one point on the toll of goodness, which weighs against your conscience, affecting how you function. All tolls are cumilitive, thus if you have 4 toll points, you incur tolls 1, 2, 3, and 4. After a long rest or a significant gesture of goodwill, you lose 1 toll point. You cannot lose more than 2 toll points within 24 hours of losing a point. If you have no toll points, you may call upon your family and kingdom for assistance in some way once per month, so long as you are aware of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\" striped-odd\" style=\"user-select: text; width: 376px; color: #191813; font-size: 13px; height: 118px;\"><caption style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Toll of Goodness</caption>\n<thead style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; height: 23px;\">\n<th class=\"col-3 text-center\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; position: relative; min-height: 1px; width: 36.6667px; height: 23px; text-align: center !important;\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Toll Points</th>\n<th class=\"col-9\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; position: relative; min-height: 1px; width: 338.667px; height: 23px;\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Toll</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; height: 19px;\">\n<td class=\"col-3 text-center\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; position: relative; min-height: 1px; width: 36.6667px; height: 19px; text-align: center !important;\">1</td>\n<td class=\"col-9\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; position: relative; min-height: 1px; width: 338.667px; height: 19px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14px;\">You realize that you have done something wrong&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14px;\">and you await some form of punishment.
