Their skin is usually a cool color, such as pale green, mauve, or sky blue in addition to being smooth and completely hairless.&nbsp;Mindflayers have a tall, sloping cranium, two roughly- humanoid eyes, and four long, coiling tendrils concealing an alien mouth evolved to open the skulls of other creatures and feed on their contents. Illithids subsist on brains, as brains provide enzymes,hormones, and vital psychic energy necessary for their survival. A healthy illithid diet consists of one sapient brain a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Illithid Names<br></span>Illithid do not have genders as other beings understand them, and reproduce via a process known as ceremorposis, which consists of producing \"tadpoles\" via parthenogenesis, then allowing them to consume the brains of other creatures, eventually mutating them into new illithids. They also use unique psychic impressions rather than names among themselves, but they do have transliterated Common equivalents to allow non-psionic creatures to address them.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Names:</strong> Altharid, Ilsenparint,&nbsp;Malinbossk, Qorik, Ullipsine, Xalliordell, Clarota.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Illithid Traits<br></span>Your mindflayer character has the following racial traits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ability Score Increase:</span>&nbsp;Your <strong>Intelligence </strong>score increases by 2, and your <strong>Charisma </strong>score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Age:</span> Illithids fully complete ceremorphosis by the age of 9, and have become fully mature and complete in their education by age 15.

In modern tales dragons are also keenly intelligent, long-lived, and magical. They lead lesser monsters, breathe elemental destruction upon those who displease them, and even demand sacrifices from mere mortals.</p>\n<p>These are the traits of power, in all its forms. Even the dragon’s hoarding of wealth is a representation of a form of power. From a human perspective, dragons are the pinnacle of evolution and the supreme creatures on the material plane. Dragons agree with this assessment.</p>\n<p>A Dragon is both a race, background, and class. You can find the class (and the background) in the Classes compendium.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Creating a Dragon Character<br></span>The biggest question when creating a Dragon player character is: why is a dragon accompanying a bunch of humanoids on their adventures? Are you seeking to build up your treasure hoard, trying to follow your ideals, or just curious about the world?</p>\n<p>Starting dragon PCs are young dragons, between one and five years old. The hatchling background supposes that your dragon was raised by humanoids, or has at least spent substantial time around them, so you’re familiar with their languages and customs.</p>\n<p>Your choice of dragon species also determines many things about your character’s personality - or at least, determines what other people will think. A metallic dragon may find themselves beseeched by the weak and helpless wherever they go, with expectations of aid and heroism. Chromatic dragons are mostly evil in nature. Evil characters usually don’t make good PCs because their selfishness can cause conflict between party members. A good or neutral chromatic dragon will still face fear, mistrust, or even outright hostility from otherwise-civilized people, until they have proven themselves virtuous.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Dragon Names<br></span>Dragons have personal names in the Draconic language, given by their parents at birth or selected by themselves. Dragons don’t put much emphasis on gender, so the same names are used by both male and female dragons. In addition, most dragons adopt an epithet — a grandiose nickname in the common tongue, which is easier for lesser creatures to understand and remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Names:</strong> Aeglyl, Cuth, Ferzath, Lareth, Nymmurh, Vuthavyth, Valeijgix, Svaergithaustrat, Aussirloex, Haurachmajak, Molikethend, Rylzrayrth, Thraethurkear, Ocuirisk, Gixustraterenesj, Dartakepesk, Adalon, Caexoth, Casarial, Grinnsira, Ixenloreat, Lymrith, Malazan, Naelere, Sirvinhandra.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Epithets:</strong>&nbsp;Blacksteel, Bloodtalon, Bravewing, Deathfrost, Fatebringer, Flamingdeath, Gemscale, Nightwind, Shadowfaith, Starseer, Stoneripper, Stormwrath, Sweetstring, Swordtooth, Toothless.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Dragon Traits<br></span>Your dragon character has the following racial traits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ability Score Increase:</span>&nbsp;Your <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Charisma</strong> scores increases by 1.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Age:</span>&nbsp;The lifecycle of a dragon has a magical component.

This focus allows them to shape their bodies to look humanoid, but must be maintained at all times. Some are so skilled at controlling tiny crystal fragments that their skin appears to be almost human-like. When a Shardmind is stunned or unconscious, some fragments flot away into orbit around him until he has the chance to regain control.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Eclectic Minds<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The psionic power that a Shardmind possesses comes from the fact that, in essence, he is a fragment of pure thought. Some of them can be very rational and calculating, but others are empathetic, timid, or hot-tempered. However, at the same time they all approach life like newborn babes, embraces the experiences arount them and attmepting to incorporate the vast stores of knowledge now open to them.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Pieces of a Whole<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Although there are various tales of origin of Shardminds, one thing that they all agree on is that they all came from the same entity, an ancient construct of great power that fell into pieces in a catastrophe that they have dubbed The Fracturing. Some say that they were once part of a great gate that was created to connect across unknown worlds. Others believe they were an entity created by the gods to deliver justice. Whatever they believe about their origin, they all know that each Shardmind is a piece of the thought of that constuct, and all of them have a longing to see themselves become whole again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"color: #782e22; font-family: Andada, serif; font-size: 18.2px; font-variant-caps: small-caps;\">Shardmind Names<br></span>As Shardminds are constructs given life through psionic power, they aren't bound by gender the way most races are.
